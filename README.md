# Slicer-EndoscopeViewingArea
Visualize and quantify the amount of the viewing area provided by the camera in 3D Slicer. The idea is to retopologize a model created from CT data with equally sized polygons and then "paint" the polygons viewed using a virtual endoscope camera.

Still a work in progress. Viewed area is visualized in red but not yet fully quantified into metrics.
